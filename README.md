Calendify allows users to browse and add various calendars to their Google Calendar. This can include a football schedule or a meeting schedule created by colleagues. Users can also create new calendars and share them with the community. We provide options to rate other calendars so users can see how well a calendar maintains new schedules.

We offer users the option to keep the calendars they create private or public, allowing them to create calendars for their own group without worrying about others viewing them.

This project is nearly finished, with only some work related to authorization left, which we hope to complete soon. We are also actively looking for platforms to deploy our project.
